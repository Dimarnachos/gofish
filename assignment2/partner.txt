Names: Nick DiMartino & Max Matias

- The both of us worked on the project together.  We collaborated over zoom and checked eachothers work using screen share.
- Nick DiMartino had more focus on the deck.c file. However, he did not work completely alone.
- Max Matias had more focus on the gofish.c file.  However, he did not work completely alone.
- Both had nearly equal part in creating the player.c file.
